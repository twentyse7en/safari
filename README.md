Layout in the youtube is not enough for this, it deserve even better. I would like to see video based on map and group them based on country. I can continue watching where I have left. I wanted to solve these pain points. But as I have built it, I have few more ideas, which could add value.

## TODO
- [ ] Add missing videos, not all the videos are added around 200 is available.
- [ ] Mark in the map which videos I have already watched, Make it blue?!. If there is more videos in country I need to watch, then I can choose shades on blue.
- [ ] May be include Sancharam videos.
